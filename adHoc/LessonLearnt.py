# Yes4All Dropship sale volume of Premium Foam Roller follows a normal distribution
# with an average demand of 50 pcs and standard deviation of demand equal to 20 pcs.
# It takes 4 days for the local suppliers to deliver. The Dropship channel requires a service level of 95% (z = 1.64)
# and monitors its inventory continuously. Further consider inventory carrying cost per pcs per period to be $ 1.6
# and ordering cost per order to be $ 4000. Suppose the Supply Chain Mgr has adopted a
# periodic review policy to manage its inventory of Premium Foam Roller, and plans to place PO every five days.
