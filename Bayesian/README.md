# Solutions-to-Problems-in-Bayesian-Statistics
This repository contains my solutions to the assignments in the book: "A Studentâ€™s Guide to Bayesian Statistics" by Ben Lambert. I will update the repository with my solutions.

##### Modeling presence of Borrelia amongst Ticks

###### Symmetric Kernel - Random Walk Metropolis
Using a Binomial likelihood, a Beta prior and an symmetric Normal jumping kernel.

###### Assymmetric Kernel - Metropolis Hastings
Using a Beta-Binomial likelihood, a Gamma prior and an assymmetric log-Normal jumping kernel.

##### Modeling Mosquito Death Rate
Using a Poisson Likelihood, a Gamma prior, a Beta Prior, a log-Normal jumping kernel and a beta jumping kernel. 
  
  
#### Chapter 14 - Gibbs Sampling

##### The sensitivity and specificity of a test for a disease - Gibbs Sampling

##### Coal mining disasters in the UK - Gibbs Sampling
Using Gibbs sampling to estimate the point in time when legislative and societal changes caused a reduction in coal mining disasters in
the UK. The number of disasters per year pre and post legislations were modeled using Poisson Likelihoods: Possion(lambda_1), Possion(lambda_2) with Gamma priors. The point in time when the new legislations were enacted is called n.
