# # This problem was asked by Google.
# #
# # You are given a set of synonyms, such as (big, large) and (eat, consume). Using this set, determine if two sentences with the same number of words are equivalent.
# #
# # For example, the following two sentences are equivalent:
# #
# # "He wants to eat food."
# # "He wants to consume food."
# # Note that the synonyms (a, b) and (a, c) do not necessarily imply (b, c): consider the case of (coach, bus) and (coach, teacher).
# #
# # Follow-up: what if we can assume that (a, b) and (a, c) do in fact imply (b, c)?
