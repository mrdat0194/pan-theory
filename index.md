## Welcome to My GitHub Pages

Here is my official documents for my self [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mrdat0194/pan-theory/edit/master/index.md).

[comment]: <> (Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll]&#40;https://jekyllrb.com/&#41; to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.)

### Time Sequence

Long Long time ago, I have created [Rpub](https://rpubs.com/PeterDat).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mrdat0194/pan-theory/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
