## Welcome to My GitHub Pages

Here is my official documents for myself [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mrdat0194/pan-theory/edit/master/index.md).

### Time Sequence

1. Long Long time ago, I started a journey by creating [Rpub](https://rpubs.com/PeterDat).

2. After working hard 'for long long time', 

*Code is organize as conda venv source for connecting with other data team to share and develop code with me*.
- Step 1: Head to and download sh file for mac: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

```
sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

- Step 2: Adding to .bash_profile and run 

```
conda update conda
```

- Step 4: setup environments

```
conda create -n pan-theory python=3
conda activate pan-theory
```

- Step 5: install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
